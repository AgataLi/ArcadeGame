## Installation

## How to Play
\\\ Your avatar is controlled by arrows. Try to get to the water. And remember - watch out enemies! Do not touch them. If you do this, the game will be over. But once you'll reached the water,  you'll won.  Close the popup window by clicking on it. And you can start from beginning. There are no points or lives. Just one chance. Like in live :P \\\
